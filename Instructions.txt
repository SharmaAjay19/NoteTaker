Also register a Bing speech recognition app on Azure and get a key. Put the value of this key in the BING_API_KEY variable in NoteTaker.py



If you want to checkout all the voices present on your system, run the VoiceChecker.py file and it will print the id's of each voice as it speaks the sentence in that voice.
Pick up the id you wish for and replace in blank spaces in "engine.setProperty('voice', '______')" on line 6 in NoteTaker.py.
